# Senior Thesis

Welcome to my senior thesis repository! This project contains code to produce the tables and plots within `R` which are stored in `output`. The final documents are included in `documents`.

The project code was the foundation for the R package `svytest` now hosted on Github as one of my repositories and on CRAN. 

Thank you for taking the time to look through my thesis! Feel free to provide comments or reach out with any questions at cnlubianski@yahoo.com.
